# Great Expectations SQL Server Project

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to use Great Expectations to analyze data in SQL Server, generate Expectation Suites, validate data, and create checkpoints.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Great Expectations library
- SQL Server instance with the AdventureWorks2012 sample database
- A valid SQL Server connection string to connect to the AdventureWorks2012 database

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
git clone <repository_url>




2. Install the required Python dependencies:
   
* pip install great_expectations
  
* pip install sqlalchemy
  
* pip install pyodbc




4. Update the `connection_string` variable in the notebook to point to your own AdventureWorks2012 database.

## Usage

Once you've completed the setup, follow these steps to run the notebook:

Open the Jupyter notebook in Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, or your preferred Jupyter environment.

Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to configure the Data Context, add the datasource, create a BatchRequest, use the built-in profiler to generate expectations, save the generated Expectation Suite, create a checkpoint, run the checkpoint, build Data Docs, and open them in the browser.

Review the generated Expectation Suite in the expectations folder, and examine validation results in the Data Docs.

Customize the notebook according to your needs, for example:

Add more datasets and batch requests to analyze and validate additional tables.
Adjust the built-in profiler's configuration to modify the way it generates expectations.
For more advanced use cases, consult the Great Expectations documentation and explore other features such as custom profilers, custom expectations, and more complex validation scenarios.

## Creating a Checkpoint

Assuming you have successfully configured your datasource and created custom Expectation Suites, use the provided script to create a Checkpoint.
